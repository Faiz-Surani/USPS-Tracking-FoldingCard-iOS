# USPS-Tracking-FoldingCard-iOS
This app is an elegant way to track your USPS packages. The basic functionality exists but much of the app is currently incomplete and/or buggy.

I wrote this to teach myself how to properly call web services and use Swift closures before implementing these things in a much larger, more expansive real-world project. At present time, I have no plans to revisit this and fully implement all the planned features, but feel free to fork this and do so.

I may still generalize some of the web service work I did into a Pod or something similar into a USPS tracking API implementation in Swift to aid future tracking app creators.
